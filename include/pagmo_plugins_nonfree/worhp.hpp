/// WORHP - (We Optimize Really Huge Problems)
/**
 * \image html worhp.png
 *
 * This class is a user-defined algorithm (UDA) that contains a plugin to the WORHP (We Optimize Really Huge Problems)
 * solver (https://worhp.de/), a software package for large-scale nonlinear optimization. WORHP is a powerful solver
 * that is able to handle robustly and efficiently constrained nonlinear opimization problems also at high
 * dimensionalities. The wrapper was developed around the version 1.12 of WORHP and the Full Feature Interface (FFI)
 * using the Unified Solver Interface and the Reverse Communication paradigm (see worhp user manual).
 *
 * \verbatim embed:rst:leading-asterisk
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *    The WORHP library is only available acquiring a licence. You can consult the web pages at
 *    (https://worhp.de/) for further information. In thse web pages you will be able to download the correct library
 *    for your architecture and obtain a license file. The WORHP user manual is also available, where the user can
 *    see what options can be set and their intended use. You will be able to specify the location of the downloaded
 *    library when constructing this UDA.
 *
 * \endverbatim
 *
 *
 * Worhp is designed to efficiently solve small- to large-scale constrained optimisation problems (single objective),
 * where the objective function and the constraints are sufficiently smooth, and may be linear, quadratic or nonlinear.
 * It is designed to find locally optimal points of optimisation problems, which may be globally optimal, depending on
 * the problem structure, the initial guess and other factors. Worhp combines  a  Sequential  Quadratic  Programming
 * (SQP) method  on  the general nonlinear level with a primal-dual Interior Point (IP) method on the quadratic
 * subproblem level, to generate a sequence of search directions, which are subject to line search using the Augmented
 * Lagrangian or L1 merit function.
 *
 * Worhp needs first and second order derivatives, which can be supplied by the user, or approximated by finite
 * differences or quasi-Newton methods by WORHP.
 *
 * In order to support pagmo's population-based optimisation model, worhp::evolve() will select
 * a single individual from the input ppnf::population to be optimised.
 * If the optimisation produces an improved individual (as established by ppnf::compare_fc()),
 * the optimised individual will be inserted back into the population.
 * The selection and replacement strategies can be configured via set_selection(const std::string &),
 * set_selection(population::size_type), set_replacement(const std::string &) and
 * set_replacement(population::size_type).
 *
 * \verbatim embed:rst:leading-asterisk
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *    This plugin for the WORHP was developed around version 1.12.1 of the worhp library and will not work with
 *    any other version.
 *
 * .. warning::
 *
 *    A moved-from :cpp:class:`ppnf::worhp` is destructible and assignable. Any other operation will result
 *    in undefined behaviour.
