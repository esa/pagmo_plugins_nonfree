/// SNOPT 7 - (Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer, Version 7)
/**
 * \image html sol.png
 *
 * This class is a user-defined algorithm (UDA) that contains a plugin to the Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer (SNOPT)
 * solver, a software package for large-scale nonlinear optimization. SNOPT is a powerful solver that is able to handle
 * robustly and efficiently constrained nonlinear opimization problems also at high dimensionalities. Since the wrapper
 * was developed around the version 7 of SNOPT the class is called ppnf::snopt7.
 *
 * \verbatim embed:rst:leading-asterisk
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *    SNOPT7 fortran code is only available acquiring a licence.
 *    If you do have such a licence, then you will also have the fortran files and can build them into the library
 *    snopt7 (one single library). The library snopt7_c will then need to be built,
 *    compiling the correct release of the project https://github.com/snopt/snopt-interface. The library thus created
 *    will link to your fortran snopt7 library. As an alternative you may have only one library libsnopt7 containing
 *    both the Fortran and the C interface (this is the case, for example, of the library you can download for
 *    evaluation).
 *
 * \endverbatim
 *
 *
 * SNOPT7 supports only single-objective minimisation, using a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm.
 * Search directions are obtained from QP subproblems that minimize a quadratic model of the Lagrangian function
 * subject to linearized constraints. An augmented Lagrangian merit function is reduced along each search
 * direction to ensure convergence from any starting point.
 *
 * In order to support pagmo's population-based optimisation model, snopt7::evolve() will select
 * a single individual from the input ppnf::population to be optimised.
 * If the optimisation produces an improved individual (as established by ppnf::compare_fc()),
 * the optimised individual will be inserted back into the population.
 * The selection and replacement strategies can be configured via set_selection(const std::string &),
 * set_selection(population::size_type), set_replacement(const std::string &) and
 * set_replacement(population::size_type).
 *
 * \verbatim embed:rst:leading-asterisk
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *    This plugin was tested with snopt version 7.2 as well as with the compiled evaluation libraries (7.7)
 *    made available via the snopt7 official web site (C/Fortran library).
 *
 * .. warning::
 *
 *    Constructing this class with an inconsistent \p minor_version parameter results in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * .. warning::
 *
 *    A moved-from :cpp:class:`ppnf::snopt7` is destructible and assignable. Any other operation will result
 *    in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * .. warning::
 *
 *    The possibility to exploit the linear part of the problem fitness, part of the original SNOPT7 library,
 *    is deactivated in this plugin for pagmo.
