SNOPT 7 - (Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer, Version 7)

This class is a user-defined algorithm (UDA) that contains a plugin to the Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer (SNOPT, V7)
solver, a software package for large-scale nonlinear optimization. SNOPT7 is a powerful solver that is able to handle
robustly and efficiently constrained nonlinear opimization problems also at high dimensionalities.

Intended use::
   >>> import pygmo as pg
   >>> import pygmo_plugins_nonfree as ppnf
   >>> uda = ppnf.snopt7(screen_output = False, library = "/usr/local/lib/libsnopt76.so", minor_version = 6)
   >>> algo = pg.algorithm(uda)

SNOPT7 supports only single-objective minimisation, using a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm.
Search directions are obtained from QP subproblems that minimize a quadratic model of the Lagrangian function
subject to linearized constraints. An augmented Lagrangian merit function is reduced along each search
direction to ensure convergence from any starting point.

In order to support pagmo's population-based optimisation model, *snopt7* selects
a single individual from the input *population* to be optimised.
If the optimisation produces an improved individual (as established by pagmo comparison criteria),
the optimised individual will be inserted back into the population.

Args:
   screen_output (``bool``): when True will activate the original screen output from SNOPT7 and deactivate the logging system based on
     :class:`~pygmo_snopt7.set_verbosity()`.
   library (``str``): the snopt7 library filename in your system (absolute path included)
   minor_version (``int``): The minor version of your Snopt7 library. Only two APIs are supported at the moment: 
     7.6 and 7.7. You may try to use this plugin with different minor version numbers, but at your own risk.

Raises:
   ArgumentError: for any conversion problems between the python types and the c++ signature

.. note::

   SNOPT7 fortran code is only available acquiring a licence.
   If you do have such a licence, then you will also have the fortran files and can build them into the library
   snopt7 (one single library). The library snopt7_c will then need to be built,
   compiling the correct release of the project https://github.com/snopt/snopt-interface. The library thus created
   will link to your fortran snopt7 library. As an alternative you may have only one library libsnopt7 containing
   both the Fortran and the C interface (this is the case, for example, of the library you can download for evaluation).

.. note::

   This plugin was tested with snopt version 7.2 as well as with the compiled evaluation libraries (7.7)
   made available via the snopt7 official web site (C/Fortran library).

.. warning::

   Constructing this class with an inconsistent *minor_version* parameter results in undefined behaviour.

.. warning::

   A moved-from :cpp:class:`ppnf::snopt7` is destructible and assignable. Any other operation will result
   in undefined behaviour.

.. warning::

   The possibility to exploit the linear part of the problem fitness, part of the original SNOPT7 library,
   is deactivated in this plugin for pagmo.

std::string snopt7_get_log_docstring()
{
    return R"(get_log()

Returns:
    ``list``: the optimisation log containing the values ``objevals``, ``objval``, ``violated``, ``viol. norm``, ``feas.``, where:

    * ``objevals`` (``int``), the number of objective function evaluations made so far
    * ``objval`` (``float``), the objective function value for the current decision vector
    * ``violated`` (``int``), the number of constraints violated by the current decision vector
    * ``viol. norm`` (``float``), the constraints violation norm for the current decision vector
    * ``feas.`` (``bool``), a boolean flag signalling the feasibility of the current decision vector (as determined by pagmo)

Raises:
    unspecified: any exception thrown by failures at the intersection between C++ and Python (e.g.,
    type conversion errors, mismatched function signatures, etc.)

.. warning::

   The number of constraints violated, the constraints violation norm and the feasibility flag stored in the log
   are all determined via the facilities and the tolerances specified within :class:`pygmo.problem`. That
   is, they might not necessarily be consistent with Snopt's notion of feasibility. See the explanation
   of how the ``"Major feasibility tolerance"`` numeric option is handled in :class:`pygmo.snopt7` and the note below.

.. note::

   The definitions of feasibility are different for SNOPT7 and pygmo. SNOPT7 requires that *max(c_viol)/||x|| <= eps_r*
   where *||x||* is the Euclidean norm of *x*, a candidate solution vector, and *eps_r* is the "Major feasibility tolerance" option in SNOPT7. 
   In contrast, pygmo requires that *c_viol <= c_tol* where *c_viol* 
   is the vector of absolute values of the nonlinear constraint violations and *c_tol* is the vector of constraint tolerances in pygmo.problem. To guarantee
   feasibility with respect to pygmo when SNOPT7 reports feasibility, try setting *eps_r <= min(c_tol)/||x||_ub*, where
   *||x||_ub* is an upper bound on the value of *||x||*. Care must be taken with this approach to ensure *eps_r* is not too small.

.. note::

   Snopt7 supports its own logging format and protocol, including the ability to print to screen and write to file.
   Snopt7's screen logging is disabled by default. It can be activated upon construction by setting the relative kwarg to ``True``

Examples:
    >>> from pygmo import *
    >>> from pygmo_plugins_nonfree import snopt7
    >>> algo = algorithm(snopt7(screen_output = False, library = "/usr/local/lib/libsnopt7.so"))

WORHP - (We Optimize Really Huge Problems)

This class is a user-defined algorithm (UDA) that contains a plugin to the WORHP (We Optimize Really Huge Problems)
solver, a software package for large-scale nonlinear optimization. WORHP is a powerful solver that is able to handle
robustly and efficiently constrained nonlinear opimization problems also at high dimensionalities. The wrapper
was developed around the version 1.14 of WORHP and the Full Feature Interface (FFI) using the Unified Solver
Interface and the Reverse Communication paradigm (see worhp user manual).

Intended use::
   >>> import pygmo as pg
   >>> import pygmo_plugins_nonfree as ppnf
   >>> uda = ppnf.worhp(screen_output = False, library = "/usr/local/lib/libworhp.so")
   >>> algo = pg.algorithm(uda)

.. note::

   The WORHP library is only available buying a licence. You can consult the web pages at
   (https://worhp.de/) for further information. There you will be able to download the correct library for your
   architecture and obtain a license file. You will be able to specify the location of the downloaded library when
   constructing this UDA.

Worhp is designed to efficiently solve small- to large-scale constrained optimisation problems, where
the objective function and the constraints are sufficiently smooth, and may be linear, quadratic or nonlinear. It is
designed to find locally optimal points of optimisation problems, which may be globally optimal, depending on the
problem structure, the initial guess and other factors. Worhp combines  a  Sequential  Quadratic  Programming  (SQP)
method  on  the general nonlinear level with a primal-dual Interior Point (IP) method on the quadratic subproblem
level, to generate a sequence of search directions, which are subject to line search using the Augmented Lagrangian
or L1 merit function.

Worhp needs first and second order derivatives, which can be supplied by the user, or approximated by finite
differences or quasi-Newton methods.

In order to support pagmo's population-based optimisation model, *worhp* selects
a single individual from the input *population* to be optimised.
If the optimisation produces an improved individual (as established by pagmo comparison criteria),
the optimised individual will be inserted back into the population.

Args:
   screen_output (``bool``): when True will activate the original screen output from WORHP and deactivate the logging system based on
     :class:`~pygmo_worhp.set_verbosity()`.
   library (``str``): the worhp library filename in your system (absolute path included)

Raises:
   ArgumentError: for any conversion problems between the python types and the c++ signature

.. note::

   This plugin for the WORHP was developed around version 1.12.1 of the worhp library. It will not 
   work with versions having a different amajor or minor version.

{
    return R"(zen_update(dr, dq, db, order)  

Apply perturbations to fitness and constraints

This method allows to apply perturbations to the constraints and objective function of the last computed problem.
It then returns an updated optimal solution without having to repeat the optimization process.
To do that, Worhp computes sensitivity matrices and gives an approximation of the new optimum.

For a detailed description and a definition of the accepted perturbations, see the Worhp Zen Manual.
The perturbation dp, a non-linear perturbation of the fitness function, is not implemented at the moment,
as it requires dedicated support of the fitness function.

Args:
    dr (``List[double]``): the perturbation of the linear multiplier
    dq (``List[double]``): perturbation added to the constraints
    db (``List[double]``): perturbation added to the box bounds
    order (``int``) the order of taylor approximation used

Returns:
    ``Tuple[List[double]]`` the updated optimum x and an approximation of the cost f

Raises:
    ValueError: the dimension of dr differs from the problem dimension
    ValueError: the dimension of dq differs from the number of constraints
    ValueError: the dimension of db differs from the problem dimension
    ValueError: runtime loading of the worhp library failed
